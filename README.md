# GrowtopiaAutofarmMenu
My take on an autofarm menu. It is based on python, and is open source. It is all based in a single file, and multiple libraries.
In order to be able to run this program properley, make sure you run, in your command prompt,
'pip3 install pynput pause pysimplegui keyboard' without the ''.
Make sure you go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install python, preferably to PATH.

UPDATE: Hold down the Q button to quit the program mid-run.
